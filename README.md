# RED-IPP2-OCIO-Config
Based on the [RED IPP2 Output Presets](https://www.red.com/download/ipp2-output-presets) I have created a minimal OCIO config of RED IPP2 for full CG projects. This is the **RED Image Processing Pipeline** in its most minimalistic and simple form:
* Inputs (textures) are in "linear"
* Rendering and Nuke working space are also in "linear"
* View Transform is for Rec.1886 display

There is no need to go wide gamut or do anything complex to **craft beautiful images**. Enjoy!

Original files (encoded in "linear-AP0") are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/fhzx0bcwcjylek1oz7kjc/ACGfmi0EHeufVOQPZLvvk7w?rlkey=53cp61955hbns8x46j6cf8k55&e=1&dl=0).

# About the config
* Reference color space is XYZ which is the base of all colourimetry
* All matrixes have been generated using [colour-science](https://www.colour-science.org/apps/) with CAT02 and DCDM XYZ
* "linear" stands for "linear_bt.709"
* "cineonlog_rec709" can be used for a matte-painting workflow in Photoshop
* "log3g10_redwg" is the shaper space. It can be used for color timing and some log operations (such as sharpen)
* Substance_painter roles were set following [this page](https://mrlixm.github.io/blog/substance-painter-color-management/)
* An inverse of the View Transform has been provided even though it is not perfect
* One may easily add several colorspaces or displays for HDR output if needed (such as "p3_d65_pq")

# Looks
* 32 looks from the [RED Creative LUT Kit](https://www.red.com/download/red-creative-lut-kit) have been uploaded
* The use of Looks is highly recommended with RED IPP2
* To use one of the looks, you need to combine it with a View. Like this for instance:

```- !<View> {name: RED IPP2 Caustic, colorspace: RED IPP2 - Rec.709 - 2.4 Gamma, looks: RED_CAUSTIC}```
